## House Rules (Builders Factory Overnight Residency)

- **Respect the space:** treat Builders Factory like a home, not a venue. Clean up after yourself; no damage to furniture, equipment, or walls.
- **Quiet zones:** keep noise reasonable in work areas at night; use designated break zones for calls or loud conversations.
- **Sleep corners:** rest areas with couches are for short naps, not for blocking others' access; be considerate when lights are dimmed.
- **No smoking, vaping, or open flames** anywhere inside the venue (including windows and bathrooms). There is a terrasse for smokers.
- **Alcohol and substances:** no illegal substances; if alcohol is present, consumption must remain moderate and compatible with a safe, professional environment.
- **Security & access:** do not let unknown people into the building; badges/wristbands must be worn at all times and shown on request.
